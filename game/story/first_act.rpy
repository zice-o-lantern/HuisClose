    "Hello everyone!"
    "You’ve just read the prologue of this game I still have to find a name for."
    "If you’ve enjoyed it, you can save here to be able to get back to where you were."
    "Though I plan to develop a bit more the prologue and start making the sprites and the visual assets."
    "So I might invite you to start a new game in the next build."
    "You might like it more!"
    "I don’t know when I’ll be able do write the following of the prologue so if you’ve liked it, don’t hesitate to send me your thoughts about it, I’d really appreciate it"
    "Anyway, hope to see you next time!"
