    n1 "I can’t find a solution to his last question and it’s come to the point I realise I can’t really do anything against Ammon."
    n1 "He’s taller than me, he’s more stylish than me, he knows a lot more about life than me, given what he has endured, and he’s a lot stronger than me."
    n1 "In the end, I guess I am all bark no bite too. I will never bite him as deep as I want because I do not have the courage nor the strength nor the wits."
    n1 "We are doomed to bark at each other with no real development. I wonder how long it’ll last, this little game of ours. Will we get bored?"
    n1 "One day, will I be able to finally feel his sharp teeth inside my neck?"
    n1 "All of a sudden, Ammon’s voice burts though my mind."

    am "Ahah, I guess I was unfair with you with that last question."
    am "Let’s say I got carried away with all of this, ahah"
    
    n1 "He grins at me, with a pained expression."

    am "You’ve won, Gappy"

    am "Here’s your prize. You deserve it."

    n1 "He launches at me the box he was keeping in secret in the trunk."
    n1 "He goes for leaning on the bike, grazing me, at the limit of giving me a shoulder bump. I watch him go, interested."

    am "Oh, By the way, next time, could you not scavenger through my stuff? That’d be nice"

    n1 "I observe his broad back when he proudly upholds his wallet and all of his stuff. Of course all of those wasn’t with me anymore."
    n1 "I admire my prize when a surge of fatigue shocks through me. I compell myself to the tall grass and lay into it to never get up again."

    ga "I’m a bit sleepy, can I take a nap? I can’t really drive in this state anyway."

    am "I bet you do. Of course you can take a nap, little kitty."

    ga "Don’t call me that ever again."

    am "Ok, little Gapgap"
    
    n1 "I yawn, I’m too tired to fight with him so I let it pass. Unfortunately the cold of the night gets to me and I start to shiver."
    n1 "I don’t know if I sleep well like that."
    n1 "Ammon noticing me shivering, decides to take off his jacket and to cover me with it. The warmth of his jacket heats up my body and soothes my heart."
    
    am "Good night, kitten."
    
    ga "Mnnhg... I.. mmm.. nt a.. kiiiii..."

    ga "He stays awake. His presence comforting me, my last strands of consciousness go away in the back of my mind."
