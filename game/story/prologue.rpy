    n1 "On days like these where the sun goes so high in the sky it could reach the other stars; by which they adnire it. Cats like me should be playing in the fields of grass."
    n1 "Although I am a bit too old to run around in fields of gras, playing with a ball of yarn, wandering over all around ’till my feet."
    n1 "I mull about this prospect for a moment, realizing I do miss those free-worries days, where I didn’t have to worry about rent, competitive exams and social relationships…"
    n1 "At least, I wasn’t {b}bored."
    n1 "The cold wind lulls the warm aspalth to sleep, still exhausted from the hundreds of travellers. But once again, the two wheels of the motorcycle rouse it back to life, annoyed."
    n1 "Looking far into the horizon, the distant red-crimson sphere holds its path and claws its glaze in me. Happy from the invitation, I brace its longing stare and return it with sweetness."
    n1 "Even his cheerful cherry pink glinted reflections in the helmet visor wont't distract me from the demonstration of enchantments life can offer. This time, I won't look away from the wonders of the world."
    n1 "Mutiple minutes pass by and my eyelids weigh like a thousand flower, dried, withered away by the centuries, regretting the decades lost to the universe.."
    n1 "Soon enough, content from its mirage of fantasia, the dying light of the sun disappears behing the horizon."
    n1 "Once gone, my eyes start to get heavy, for all they have been doing today is enduring the long day of road I've made, relieved the bright peach light has flown away for another place, warmer and greener."
    n1 "For a moment, I find myself complying with my inner desire and give in the call of slumber. Falling down, I meet with the peaceful world of Wonderland where the misery is shrinking away and complete bliss is growing closer."

    am "Hey Gap? Are you sleepy?"

    am "Hey are you there??!"

    n1 "Boiling and beating his chest; A shiver runs through my spine, then another one. A old sentiment all too familiar grows inside of me and I don’t like it. I don’t want to find out what happens next if he keeps at it."

    n1 "After some time, a sort of strange quietness grew and loomed over the both of us. It was uncomfortable, as wondering what might have caused all of this agitation early on."
    n1 "The guiltiness start to take its toll over me, for I have failed to keep focused on the road. A mingle of shame builds up in my throat and it’s stuck no matter how much I gulp."
    n1 "I throw some quick looks in the mirror to see if there’s any casualties with Ammon. Apparently he’s fine so I start to relax a bit."
    n1 "Although his undecypherable gaze under his helmet make it difficult to know for sure but his ominous aura penetrates all of my pores tinges all of my hair."
    n1 "At some point, the silente itches me; I want to stop driving and scratch the back of my head, his cold stare is staggering the back of my neck."
    n1 "The hum of the vehicle barely barely fills the glacial air and no matter how much fast I go, the biting frost won’t stop nimbling on me."

    n1 "Constating the situation hasn’t evolved——I could’ve not picked enough information given the situation anyway——I try to think up something to break the ice."
    n1 "I hesitate, I didn’t do anything wrong right? I just was unfocused for a moment and got back in control pretty fast. Nothing to write home about."
    n1 "I squeeze the handlebar, fearing the moment I’ll have to open my mouth about it. It couldn’t be that hard, am I right?"

    n1 "He reasserts himself. He crosses his arm sternly. It looks like his pride has been shamelessly plundered. He looks away and avoids my glaze. He shows a face of discomfort and akwardness."
    n1 "That took him a lot of efforts, apparently——I mean, he’s the type to be a shithead about it—— he wronged mo a lot of times and he doesn’t up usually own up to it."
    n1 "I grin bittersweetly, realizing I have been cut off in my tremendous amends."

    ga "I forgive you.{w} I apologize too. I should’ve kept my eyes on the road. It’s been irresonsible of me."

            am "I’ll catch you before you can even lay a finger on it"
            am "Understood, little kitten?"
            n1 "I look around to look for an argument to rebut him but I don’t find one."
            n1 "He is faster than me."

    am "Anyway, no matter what you’re planning, it’s not important, right?"
    n1 "I stop my track of thought to consider what he just said."
    n1 "What started as a joke derailed in a nerve-breaking game."
    am "You might be able to do whatever you’ve thought of.{w} But you aren’t willing to, huh?"
    am "You might wave your tail around throwing at me threats thinking you could best me."
    am "You could intimidate me with your imposing demeanor. But you’ve got nothing"
    am "And in the end… Don’t threaten me with a good time, will you, honey?"
    n1 "When he’s done doing his little speech, he inches closer to my face and I supress the urge to recoil. I must resist to him. He’s gone too far without me retaliating."
    n1 "He takes a long drag of his cigarette; I wait for him to finish, preparing myself to his next blow, whatever that might be. He won’t take me down."
    n1 "He closes the distance between our mouths. Whatever he might try it’s just a bluff. Still I find myself closing my eyes, dreading for the impact. But nothing happens."
    n1 "When I finally reopens my eyes, what I believed before was a wisenheimer cat presents to me as the Big Bad Wolf."   
    n1 "He huffs and huffs and then finally puffs. A veil of smoke flows through my nose and my lips and I can’t help but cough and cough without a break. But I won’t be defeated."
    am "So happy?"
    n1 "Ammon expects an answer, self-satisfied with his stunt."
    n1 "However a puff of smoke goes through his face and he recoils back. coughing uncontrollably. Once his coughing fit done, he raises his head back shocked by the trick I've managed"
    n1 "I walk away free from his grasp, from his little game, successful. The wind comes congratulating me, moving my frail and sensible ears. I brush my hair to set it back."
    ga "Yeah. I'm happy"
    n1 "I cast a quick side eye look so that I can observe his reaction."
    n1 "He's smirking, that bastard. He likes it"
    n1 "And I like it too"
    n1 "But he {b}did{/b} have some cigarette on him. That wasn’t his last."
    n1 "One way or the other, I’ll get back at him for his lie. I’m sure it still wasn’t his last."

    am "Anyway, who have you talked to? Julie I guess"
    n1 "Walking towards the driver seat, I stop; I could sense some bittersweetness in his voice but I decide to ignore it."
    n1 "Besides, it’s not like I could make him admit. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves."
    am "You can't go a day without her, can you?"
    ga "I needed to check something with her. I forgot some stuff at home."

    am "Is it all you have talked about?"
    n1 "It’s starting to get on my nerves. I can’t help but notice his suspicious tone, wary of me. My back to him, I look down trying to not think about the phone call."
    ga "Everything’s fine, don’t worry."

    am "Oh btw, can you open the trunk for me?"
    n1 "I turn around, and I glance at him, puzzled. What was the matter with the trunk? That tells me something but it’s hard to remember."
    n1 "Ammon, destabilsed by my sudden amnesia, fidget his cigarette, unsure if he said anythin wrong."
    am "You know, the book I was looking for"
    n1 "Là je suis fatigué donc on va speedrun là."
    n1 "Gasperd va dans la voiture."
