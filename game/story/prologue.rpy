    "Where, before you were stranded away in the milky way, comtemplating about the mysteries of the universe, where the shining stars watched over you, you find yourself on a motorcycle."
    "A sharp pain pervades your whole being like a blooming rose planting her thorny roots in every part of your spirit."

    "In your little world, you were no more significant than a grain of salt swept over by the wind on a sunny beach. No matter you’ll end up, you’ll be content with the result."
    "The dying sun at the horizon sends you its adieu and lays down behind the horizon at slow but certain pace."
    "The last glimmers of lights highlights the majestic landscapes the road has to offer. \nThere were multiple sceneries you could transfer onto a pellicule for everyone to admire at home."
    "Some black forest, deep as the never–ending void where no light never escapes, some striking high mountains, candidates to the siege of the Olympus."
    "Some sunflowers, dispersed in the grand lands of tall grasses, don’t know anymore where to turn their head to, their leader gone astray, to never be seen again."
    "All these landscapes appear gorgeous and alluring to you on the road but they were even more exquisite from your moderate village, where you have resided from as long as you can recollect your memories."
    "You remember, observing them, from the window of your lonely bedroom, dreaming of one day, going on a journey to find an unestimate treasure."

    "Maybe not just to the outside."
    "You went on doing a PhD and your father still wears that apathetic face. At least he would if he’d been still there. You haven’t seen him for a long time..."

    # "The cold wind lulls the warm aspalth to sleep, still tired from the hundreds of travellers. But once again, the two wheels of the motorcycle rouse it back to life, annoyed."
    # "Looking far into the horizon, the distant red-crimson sphere holds its path and claws its glaze in you. Enchanted from its invitation, You brace in its longing stare and return it with sweetness."
