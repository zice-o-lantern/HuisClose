    "You wake up at the hum of the radio, a bit shaken up, with drool staining your helmet visor — Fortunately there’s not enough to hide your vision."
    "Where, before you were stranded away in the milky way, comtemplating about the mysteries of the universe, where the shining stars watched over you, you find yourself on a motorcycle."
    "A sharp pain pervades your whole being like a blooming rose planting her thorny roots in every part of your spirit."
    "The radio was blastering loud some song from a rock band you appreciated a lot, although you dare not admit it in public, as it was strongly frowned upon among your elders."
    "It’s alright, you think; nobody’s here to disturb you in your little trance."

    "In your little world, you were no more significant than a grain of salt swept over by the wind on a sunny beach. No matter you’ll end up, you’ll be content with the result."
    "The dying sun at the horizon sends you its adieu and lays down behind the horizon at slow but certain pace."
    "The last glimmers of lights highlights the majestic landscapes the road has to offer. \nThere were multiple sceneries you could transfer onto a pellicule for everyone to admire at home."
    "Some black forest, deep as the never–ending void where no light never escapes, some striking high mountains, candidates to the siege of the Olympus."
    "Some sunflowers, dispersed in the grand lands of tall grasses, don’t know anymore where to turn their head to, their leader gone astray, to never be seen again."
    "All these landscapes appear gorgeous and alluring to you on the road but they were even more exquisite from your moderate village, where you have resided from as long as you can recollect your memories."
    "You remember, observing them, from the window of your lonely bedroom, dreaming of one day, going on a journey to find an unestimate treasure."
    "You lived quite some adventures in this very room. Afraid of the outside, your little journey didn’t go very far."
    "It happenend often that you wake up and decide that you’d be a cook or an explorer, or any revelation you had on this particular day."

    "Maybe not just to the outside."
    "You went on doing a PhD and your father still wears that apathetic face. At least he would if he’d been still there. You haven’t seen him for a long time..."
    "Or you have? You think you really have but you don’t remember when. Was it Yesterday? Last week? Last month?.. Last year, surely. It’s on the edge of your mind but something prevents you to remember."

    # # "Mutiple minutes pass by and my eyelids weigh like a thousand of flowers, dried, withered away by the centuries."
    # # "Mutliples minutes pass by and my eyes sprout a thousand of flowers, stinging my eyes, demanding a desereved rest."

Breathing in here is pain all accross your lungs and the heat rises considerably. Steam roses of your red cheeks and you huff to no end, pleading the air to come back. But it never came."

    "The one at the stepdoor, yes it was. He went missing. He didn't even try to look after you. He left. He doesn't care about you. You doesn't care about him. You hate him."
    "You followed him on the pavement. Did you follow him further? You think so. It doesn't matter. He shouldn't have come. He had to shut it. She has to shut it now. Shut it, shut it, shut it"

    "A loud crash echoes and resonates within the phone booth. Slumped down, you don’t move anymore. Your head’s empty but a shrill and piercing white noise in your ears. You’re clawed to the ground and won’t get anymore."
    "When your bloodied vision sets back into focus, you observe with a dead eye the destroyed–to—thousand—pieces receiver on the ground, you come to wonder what has guided you to this point. You rise your hands at eye–level vision to watch the blood spill out of your hands." 
    "What happened that has come to you bloodying them. {w} What happened Semptember Friday the 13th?"

    "You rush back towards the bike in hope to flee the burning rising inside the glacial heart of yours you wish you could shut out. The more you run, The more the distance between you and the vehicle stretches to unreasonable length, the cicadas, witnessing this pitiful performance, coulnd’t hold back their laughter."
    "Heinous hyenas; that’s what they are. You could mistake them for buzzing, singing, drilling or cries, but I hear them very well: it was a loud sarcastic cackle."
    "Sweat drops blur my vision. Or maybe it was tears. Either way, the distorted landscapes didn’t come back once I’ve run through the kilometers to reach the bike."
    "The metallic frame as my only support, I huff and huff, grasping for air. The turtleneck tightening my neck for a long time, decided it was time to choke me. Not able to bear it anymore, I start to get rid of my sweater that was imprisoning and suffocating me."

    am "Huh, Gaspard? Are you alright?"

    "A familar voice and the sound of a belt swinging around rise my ears like antenna and stops me dead in my tracks. I slowly turn around my head to be met with the concerned face of a dog with his belt unbuckled."
    "An embarrassing contest of glances followed and I coulnd’t break the glaze. He finally buckles it up but that expression mixed with fear and inquisitiveness doesn’t disappear at all."

    am "Were you...{w} undressing? Why do you sweat so much?"
    ## TODO: Make him joke about undressing (it’s not a contest)

    "He drowns me with questions."

    am "Who did you call? Was it Julie? What did she tell you?"

    ga "Your fly."

    am "My... what?"

    ga "Your fly’s opened."

    "Ammon looks down, confused, to notice that, indeed, his fly is opened. He zips it up and raises his head back with an unamused look."

    am "… Anyway, have you been running?"

    "I quickly search for an excuse and determine that his proposition is the best outcome."

    ga "Exactly... {w} I was making a little jog to make me stay awake."

    "Ammon approaches me, maintaning the gaze as if just looking away will break the link between us."
    "At close range, he lays down his hand on my shoulder. His claws soflty brush my jacket. I know it is a very arduous task for him to be that considerate."

    am "Do you want to talk about what just happened?"

    ga "No… I’m alright."

    "He helps me set back my sweater. It’s embarrassing coming from him that my cheeks get warm."

    am "Well if you need anything, tell me huh? I ’ll always be there."
    
    "He pats me on the shoulder."
    # "In this moment, I wanted to embrace him, pour my heart out to him, open it so he can see all of its content,\nso he can finally unsterdand me, \nso he can finally see mo for who I am."
    "Deep down, a little voice whispers to me \"Just open up\" \"What are you waiting for\" \"He won’t be always there for you\" and my arms move on their own towards the reassuring friend."
    "A puddle of emotions rains down my throat and dwells deep in my stomach. Some butterflies care not to get close of it, fly away to not be seen again. All of a sudden, my limbs fall dead, the threads maintaining them alive and up, slashed through, unfairly."
    "Nothing remains in my throat but a fragile cry and I mutter it."

    ga "Ok."

    "His message conveyed, he turns back and goes away, satsified."

    ga "Thank you... Amo."

    am "No problem, Gap"

    "Some time passes and the tension in my clenched fists start to gradually loosen. Catching my breath has become easier and I am able to relax at this point."
    "When I can discern at least discern my breathing out of my heartbeat, I observe the landscapes, happy that my surroundings are peaceful."
    "I notice Ammon leaning against the bike, admiring too the sceneries. His look wanders over the horizon, maybe reaching for its end, leaping over the mountains and the clouds."
    "He’s conviced that, if you look hard enough, you should find it no matter how much time you spent; I smile."
    "I mull over the fact that I’ve been hard with Ammon. Maybe I put too much pressure on him. Lately, I do have a lot of tantrums. But I don’t know where it’s coming from."
    "Every time I try to dig deeper, I am met with an impenetrable wall, high, very high like the Rappunzel tower, pleading me to get up but I find myself just standing there, not able to process what’s in front."
    "I am scared of what’s over yonder that wall, what I could find.{w} Maybe that’s why it is so high…"
    "Lost in thought, I realise Ammon has been looking at me, his back still in my view. He shivers a bit because of the cold air——it is starting to be late."
    "Once gazes met, he wears for me a sad smile, meaning a thousand words and everything and the same time, I don’t get him."
    "I wonder to what he really thinks about. His aspirations, his dreams? Behind that Iron mask I wish I could see his genuine smile more otften."
    "Unfortunately, I know he doen’t open up to me that much. The key to his heart has been trampled on, stolen long ago by his relatives, and me unable to do anything about it." 
    "I return the smile, trying to cheer him up, despite knowing it’s ineffective for the statue of stone there."
    "By the time, my breathing stabilised and I feel the tiredness building up my spine, like the gravity inviting me to sleep on the comfortable ground."

    am "Do you think you will be able to take back the road? You’re a bit sleepy."
    
    ga "Right know, I don’t think so."

    am "Alright, take some rest."

    "I take his advice and sit on the grass, falling asleep."
    ## TODO: Do a blink animation.
    "But I jerk my eyes open when I hear a familiar sound in the vicinity of Ammon"
    "He brings out a box of cigarettes out of his breast pocket and pulls one out."
    "I eye it enviously, hopelessy searching for calming down, I forgot mine so I am happy that he still has some."

    ga "Hey can I have a smoke?"

    am "Sorry it’s my last one, gapgap."

    ## NOTE: Maybe smooth the transition here, a bit abrupt

    # "He shows me the inside of the box of cigarettes. Empty. It’s empty."
    # "Gapgap..? Gapgap??? Why he’s calling me like that? I hate this nickname."
    # "And what’s with him? He smokes like he breathes, I’m sure he has still some left and nonetheless here’s his response."
    # "The heat of this affront climbs up my head and sweat steans off my hair."
    # "My arms stiffen like rugged sturdy sticks, my fingers pressed against my palm that my claws makes it bleed."
    # "Did he just lie?"
    # "He’s lying. A damn liar. After all he’s just said, he dares to lie to me?"
    # "I know he’s lying. He wouldn’t go to a trip without refilling his stock of cigarettes; he’s addicted to it."
    # "I can see his shifty {b}guilty{/b} eyes avoid my mine."

    am "What are you doing looking at me like that? You should’ve brought your own smokes."
    
    "A sip of smoke whisks away from his long dirty satisfied muzzle. He really thinks that I won’t do anything?"
    "That’s it. I’m going to bust you up, Ammon. I’m going to make you pay for this affront. You well regret having the nerve to do that."
    "All of the sudden, My throat feels like sandpaper. I’m thirsty. My revenge can wait."

    ga "Ok, I’m going to look for a water bottle in the trunk."

    # am "Wait I need to get a drink too."

    # "Before I can stand up, he rushes towards the top—box and opens it."
    # "I’m a bit curious if he’s going to get a bottle of water so I slowly get up and patiently observe him."
    # "At first, I thought he was done with his task since I saw him grab something."
    # "However, he now rummages in his stuff and sometimes pulls out some items like some photos, his wallet and on and on."
    # "Confused, I question what he is really come to get but not until long, he closes the trunk and comes closer to me with a bottle of water in his hand."
    # "I reach for the bottle but then——"
    
    # am "Oh sorry, it’s for me. I forgot to take one for you."
