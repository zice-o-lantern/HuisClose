    n1 "On days like these where the sun goes so high in the sky it could reach the other stars; by which they adnire it. Cats like me should be playing in the fields of grass."
    n1 "Although I am a bit too old to run around in fields of gras, playing with a ball of yarn, wandering over all around ’till my feet."
    n1 "I mull about this prospect for a moment, realizing I do miss those free-worries days, where I didn’t have to worry about rent, competitive exams and social relationships…"
    n1 "At least, I wasn’t {b}bored."
    n1 "The cold wind lulls the warm aspalth to sleep, still exhausted from the hundreds of travellers. But once again, the two wheels of the motorcycle rouse it back to life, annoyed."
    n1 "Looking far into the horizon, the distant red-crimson sphere holds its path and claws its glaze in me. Happy from the invitation, I brace its longing stare and return it with sweetness."
    n1 "Even his cheerful cherry pink glinted reflections in the helmet visor wont't distract me from the demonstration of enchantments life can offer. This time, I won't look away from the wonders of the world."
    n1 "Mutiple minutes pass by and my eyelids weigh like a thousand flower, dried, withered away by the centuries, regretting the decades lost to the universe.."
    n1 "Soon enough, content from its mirage of fantasia, the dying light of the sun disappears behing the horizon."
    n1 "Once gone, my eyes start to get heavy, for all they have been doing today is enduring the long day of road I've made, relieved the bright peach light has flown away for another place, warmer and greener."
    n1 "For a moment, I find myself complying with my inner desire and give in the call of slumber. Falling down, I meet with the peaceful world of Wonderland where the misery is shrinking away and complete bliss is growing closer."

    am "Hey Gap? Are you sleepy?"

    n1 "After some time, a sort of strange quietness grew and loomed over the both of us. It was uncomfortable, as wondering what might have caused all of this agitation early on."
    n1 "The guiltiness start to take its toll over me, for I have failed to keep focused on the road. A mingle of shame builds up in my throat and it’s stuck no matter how much I gulp."
    n1 "I throw some quick looks in the mirror to see if there’s any casualties with Ammon. Apparently he’s fine so I start to relax a bit."
    n1 "Although his undecypherable gaze under his helmet make it difficult to know for sure but his ominous aura penetrates all of my pores tinges all of my hair."
    n1 "At some point, the silente itches me; I want to stop driving and scratch the back of my head, his cold stare is staggering the back of my neck."

    n1 "Constating the situation hasn’t evolved——I could’ve not picked enough information given the situation anyway——I try to think up something to break the ice."
    n1 "I hesitate, I didn’t do anything wrong right? I just was unfocused for a moment and got back in control pretty fast. Nothing to write home about."
    n1 "I squeeze the handlebar, fearing the moment I’ll have to open my mouth about it. It couldn’t be that hard, am I right?"

    n1 "He reasserts himself. He crosses his arm sternly. It looks like his pride has been shamelessly plundered. He looks away and avoids my glaze. He shows a face of discomfort and akwardness."
    n1 "That took him a lot of efforts, apparently——I mean, he’s the type to be a shithead about it—— he wronged mo a lot of times and he doesn’t up usually own up to it."

    am "And it looks like you’re getting sleepy so I’ll get just right enough on your nerves to keep you awake."

    ga "And you’re damn good at it because I already want to shut closed that mouthy trap of yours."

    n1 "Not able to bear it anymore, I start to get rid of my sweater that was imprisoning and suffocating me."

    am "Huh, Gaspard? Are you alright?"

    n1 "A familar voice and the sound of a belt swinging around rise my ears like antenna and stops me dead in my tracks."
    n1 "I slowly turn around my head to be met with the concerned face of a dog with his belt unbuckled."
    n1 "An embarrassing contest of glances followed and I coulnd’t break the glaze."
    n1 "He finally buckles it up but that expression mixed with fear and inquisitiveness doesn’t disappear at all."

    am "Were you...{w} undressing? Why do you sweat so much?"

    n1 "He drowns me with questions."

    am "Who did you call? Was it Julie? What did she tell you?"

    ga "Your fly."

    am "My... what?"

    ga "Your fly’s opened."

    n1 "Ammon looks down, confused, to notice that, indeed, his fly is opened. He zips it up and raises his head back with an unamused look."

    am "… Anyway, have you been running?"

    n1 "I quickly search for an excuse and determine that his proposition is the best outcome."

    ga "Exactly... {w} I was making a little jog to make me stay awake."

    n1 "Ammon approaches me, maintaning the gaze as if just looking away will break the link between us."
    n1 "At close range, he lays down his hand on my shoulder. His claws soflty brush my jacket. I know it is a very arduous task for him to be that considerate."

    am "Do you want to talk about what just happened?"

    ga "No… I’m alright."

    n1 "He helps me set back my sweater. It’s embarrassing coming from him that my cheeks get warm."

    am "Well if you need anything, tell me huh? I ’ll always be there."
    
    n1 "He pats me on the shoulder."
    n1 "In this moment, I wanted to embrace him, pour my heart out to him, open it so he can see all of its content,\nso he can finally unsterdand me, \nso he can finally see mo for who I am."
    n1 "A puddle of emotions rains down my throat and dwells deep in my stomach. Some butterflies care not to get close of it, fly away to not be seen again."
    n1 "But I can’t say anything. {w} I can’t say anything but——"

    ga "Ok."

    n1 "His message conveyed, he turns back and goes away, satsified."

    ga "Thank you... Amo."

    am "No problem, Gap"

    n1 "Walking without a care in the world, he brings out a box of cigarettes out of his breast pocket and pulls one out."
    n1 "I eye it enviously, hopelessy searching for calming down, I forgot mine so I am happy that he still has some."

    ga "Hey can I have a smoke?"

    am "Sorry it’s my last one."

    n1 "He’s lying. A damn liar. After all he’s just said, he dares to lie to me?"
    n1 "I know he’s lying. He wouldn’t go to a trip without refilling his stock of cigarettes; he’s addicted to it."
    n1 "I can see his shifty {b}guilty{/b} eyes avoid my gaze."

    am "What are doing looking at me like that? You should’ve brought your own smokes."
    
    n1 "A sip of smoke whisks away from his long dirty satisfied muzzle. He really thinks that I won’t do anything?"
    n1 "That’s it. I’m going to bust you up, Ammon. I’m going to make you pay for this affront. You well regret having the nerve to do that."
    n1 "All of the sudden, My throat feels like sandpaper. I’m thirsty. My revenge can wait."

    ga "Ok, I’m going to look for a water bottle in the trunk."

    am "Suit youself."
    # n1 "But then, he sets back to his usual unfazed face. Slowly and carefully, he puts his hand on his breast jacket pocket and pulls out a cigarette."
    # n1 "A fucking cigarette and he waves it between my two eyes."
    # ga "Wha– You’ve said it was your last one! Give it to m—"
    # am "Shh—"
    # n1 "I behold a finger in front of me on my mouth keeping it shut."
    # n1 "The audacity of this man.{w} I gulp."
    # n1 "He pulls out his lighter and light it in a quck manner to taunt me. He starts to take a long, and even long drag until the cigarette is dried down."
    # n1 "Then, he puffs in the air, a large cloud of smoke ascending at a slow pace. With a step onward, he prepares his unstoppable onslaught."
    # am "Hmm… Let's admit that.{w} Let's admit you are able to abandon me here."
    # n1 "He pauses and he takes a look around."
    # am "Let’s make the thought process : abandoning me with the crickets and the cry of the cicadas."
    # n1 "He locks eyes with me, and he won’t look away no matter how much step backward I make."
    # n1 "Suddenly, my foot can’t go further. It’s blocked. The car is there."
    # n1 "For seconds, he stares at me looking while a trail of smoke follows his way."
    # n1 "I cross my arms waiting for his offense"
    # am "Tell me, what would you do to abandon me down there."
