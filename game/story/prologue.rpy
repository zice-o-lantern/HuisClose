    Me "Honestly{w=.5}, I couldn’t believe me strangling my father at the stepdoor."
    Me "Or was it the stepdoor? {w=.25}Maybe it was on the pavement."

    Me "Before you condemn me of indifference, I would like to do my mea-culpa and warn you that I know nothing in life and I am not in anyway qualified to submit a verdict."
    Me "It just happened that I am on a branching path where I can’t cower behind my hide and must take on the complex dilemma that I have been defied with."
    Me "Is Boredom a crime? Let me rephrase: Can my lethargy cause irreparable wrongdoings for the world around me. By all means, I’ve tried and I’ve succeded to not hurt anyone."
    Me "Is my dullness the root of all the issues I experienced since I’ve set foot on this forsaken Earth while I couldn’t see anything for my obliviousness?"
    Me "No I don’t think so ; trust me, please, I’ve been pondering about it for a long time ; Being bored isn’t a crime as other form of boredom like Indifference, Lethargy or even Apathy."

    Ammon "Hey! Stop daydreaming! You’re driving."
    Me "That stirs me out of my euphoric trance and I turn at him"
    Gasperd "Ah! Oh my god, sorry!"
    Gasperd "Don’t shout like this. You’re really gonna send us flying into the ditch"
    Ammon "LOOK AT THE FORSAKEN ROAD YOU MORON. STOP LOOKING AT ME."
    Me "Realising what I am doing, I quickly lose focus of my friend and focus back on the road."
    Me "Well, fortunately, nothing happened or crossed the road during our argument."
    Me "Given I wasn’t really paying attention beforehand, we’re lucky a hedgehog didn’t cross the road or a rabbit didn’t hop on."
    Me "I breathe a sigh of a relief and let of all my muscles relax."
    Me "I still don’t lose sight of the route ; my cheeks start to get pretty red."
    Me "Seconds are passing by and soon minutes and it wont’t stop getting warmer."
    Me "My shoulders slowly and slowly swallow the top of my body ; I’m quickly reminded that I should focus on the road so my head bounces back up to place."
    Me "That was careless of me but Carl’s intervention distracted me even more…"
    Me "… Speaking of him, he hasn’t talked since the altercation."
    Me "I can see him on the corner of my eyes that he’s crossed his arms and got slouched on the seat."
    Me "To get around his vigilance, I glance at him through the inner rear mirror."
    Me "He’s on the point of resting his legs on the driveboard, but he knows he can’t because I would instantly scold him."
    Me "The silence between us grows thicker and starts to create a sultry space void."
    Me "And the car radio music does not help fill the blank…"
    Me "It starts to really unsettle me so I think up of a thing to say."
    Me "I take a breath and open my mouth."

    Gasperd "I huh apolog"
    Ammon "Sorry.{w=.5}.{w=.125}.{w=.125} for yelling at you. Got carried away."
    Ammon "I am a bit on the nerves. I reacted too hard on you, it was…{w=.5} irresponsible of me."
    Gasperd "I apologise too…"
    Gasperd "I apologise for getting distracted that much. it was…"
    Me "The words stop in their tracks and I throw him a quick look, smirking."
    Gasperd "… irresponsible of me."
    Me "Ammon snickers."
    Ammon "Why are you repeating what I said?"
    Me "He opens the glove box and start rummaging."
    Me "I try to not pay attention to what he's doing."
    Gasperd "Why not? I think it's funny."
    Ammon "It's not. You're just making fun of me."
    Me "He starts searching frenetically in the box."
    Gasperd "Well, don't you like it?"
    Ammon "If I like it?"
    Me "Ammon stops searching though the box. He pauses."
    Ammon "Of course not! Would you like being run over by a car?"
    Gasperd "A car??? That's how you feel about me?"
    Me "I turn my head to shoot at him my most severe ironic glance."
    # Me "But Ammon shouts."
    Ammon "Eyes on the road, God damn it!!!"
    Gasperd "Oh please, could you say it more gently??{w=.5} What you’re doing is really counterproductive."
    Me "Both of us drop in silence. Then laughter erupts in the air."
    Me "It takes us a lot of time to calm ourselves."
    Ammon "Ahah… It’s been so long…"
    Gasperd "It’s been so long since what? Since you’ve laughed? A bit grim, don’t you think?"
    Ammon "No, no…{w=.5} Well maybe."
    Me "Slumped in his seat, he looks wishfully at the scenery"
    Ammon "Since…{w=.25} Since…{w=.25} {b}we{/b}’ve laughed like that."
    Gasperd "You mean… since what happened last week?"
    Ammon "Oh come on, you know very well you weren’t smiling a bunch even before."
    Me "No, I didn’t know, actually. What does that mean? Am I that much of a downer?"
    Gasperd "Are you telling me I don’t smile enough?"
    Ammon "I’m not saying that…"
    Me "His avoiding gaze says it."
    Me "Ammon gets back to look in the glove…{w=.5} Again."
    Me "The stuff inside it clashes into each other like he went to take a hike in a minefield and stepped on every possible mine."
    Gasperd "You know, you won’t get what you want after you’ve looked for the 59th time."
    Ammon "I known, I know!"
